    <body class = "background">
        <div class = "centered"><h1>Ballroom dance</h1></div>
        <p>The sport that I have historically enjoyed the most is Ballroom dance. I first found it in middle school, when one of my best friend's older sisters invited me to attend the school ballroom class with her, seeing as they needed more guys. I quickly fell in love with this art, and then competed it for almost 6 years.</p>
        <p>There are 2 main styles of Ballroom Dance; here they are, with their respective dances.</p>

        <ol class = "common">
            <li>Standard</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Waltz</li>
                    <li>Viennese Waltz</li>
                    <li>Foxtrot</li>
                    <li>Quickstep</li>
                    <li>Tango</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Latin</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Samba</li>
                    <li>Rhumba</li>
                    <li>Cha-Cha</li>
                    <li>Jive</li>
                    <li>Pasodoble</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>

        <div class = "common" class = "spacing">Here is a picture of a couple dancing one of the lesser known dances--the pasodoble:</div><br>

        <p>Finally, there are a couple other requirements this from-scratch page needs to fulfill in order for me to receive full credit for this project. Here is a bullet point list that fulfills the remaining requirements:</p>
